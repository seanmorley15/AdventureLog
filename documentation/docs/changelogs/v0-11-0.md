# AdventureLog v0.11.0 - Strava + Wanderer Integration, New UI, and More

Released 09-02-2025

Hi everyone,

I’m thrilled to announce **AdventureLog v0.11.0** - a huge update that **completely reimagines how you track and plan your adventures**. Adventures are now officially called **Locations**, and you can enrich them with **Activities** and **Trails**, whether added manually or imported via Strava and Wanderer.

On top of that, the app has a **full UI rewrite** with a cleaner, smoother interface, enhanced navigation, and improved mobile experience. Combined with expanded localization, this release gives you more ways than ever to explore, manage, and relive your journeys.
