# Installation with Traefik

Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. It is designed to be simple to use and configure, and it integrates well with Docker.

AdventureLog has a built-in Traefik configuration that makes it easy to deploy and manage your AdventureLog instance.

The most recent version of [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file includes example Traefik container labels. To deploy Traefik itself, consult the [Traefik v3.x documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/).
