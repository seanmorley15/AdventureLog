# How to use AdventureLog

Welcome to AdventureLog! This guide will help you get started with AdventureLog and provide you with an overview of the features available to you.

## Key Terms

#### Locations

::: tip Terminology Update
**Location has replaced Adventure:**  
The term "Location" is now used instead of "Adventure" - the usage remains the same, just the name has changed to better reflect the purpose of the feature.
:::

- **Location**: think of a location as a point on a map, a place you want to visit, have visited, or a place you want to explore. A location can be anything you want it to be, from a local park to a famous landmark. These are the building blocks of AdventureLog and are the fundamental unit of information in the app.
- **Visit**: a visit is added to an location. It contains a date and notes about when the location was visited. If a location is visited multiple times, multiple visits can be added. If there are no visits on a location or the date of all visits is in the future, the location is considered planned. If the date of the visit is in the past, the location is considered completed.
- **Category**: a category is a way to group locations together. For example, you could have a category for parks, a category for museums, and a category for restaurants.
- **Tag**: a tag is a way to add additional information to a location. For example, you could have a tag for the type of cuisine at a restaurant or the type of art at a museum. Multiple tags can be added to a location.
- **Image**: an image is a photo that is added to a location. Images can be added to a location to provide a visual representation or to capture a memory of the visit. These can be uploaded from your device or with a service like [Immich](/docs/configuration/immich_integration) if the integration is enabled.
- **Attachment**: an attachment is a file that is added to a location. Attachments can be added to a location to provide additional information, such as a map of the location or a brochure from the visit.

#### Collections

- **Collection**: a collection is a way to group locations together. Collections are flexible and can be used in many ways. When no start or end date is added to a collection, it acts like a folder to group locations together. When a start and end date is added to a collection, it acts like a trip to group locations together that were visited during that time period. With start and end dates, the collection is transformed into a full itinerary with a map showing the route taken between locations. For example, you could have a collection for a trip to Europe with dates so you can plan where you want to visit, a collection for a local hiking trails, or a collection for a list of restaurants you want to try.
- **Transportation**: a transportation is a collection exclusive feature that allows you to add transportation information to your trip. This can be used to show the route taken between locations and the mode of transportation used. It can also be used to track flight information, such as flight number and departure time.

This can be used to plan where you will stay during your trip and add notes about the lodging location. It can also be used to track reservation information, such as reservation number and check-in time.
- **Note**: a note is a collection exclusive feature that allows you to add notes to your trip. This can be used to add additional information about your trip, such as a summary of the trip or a list of things to do. Notes can be assigned to a specific day of the trip to help organize the information.
- **Checklist**: a checklist is a collection exclusive feature that allows you to add a checklist to your trip.
