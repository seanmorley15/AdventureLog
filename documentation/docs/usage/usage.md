# How to use AdventureLog

Welcome to AdventureLog! This guide will help you get started with AdventureLog and provide you with an overview of the features available to you.

## Key Terms

#### Adventures

- **Adventure**: think of an adventure as a point on a map, a location you want to visit, or a place you want to explore. An adventure can be anything you want it to be, from a local park to a famous landmark.
- **Visit**: a visit is added to an adventure. It contains a date and notes about when the adventure was visited. If an adventure is visited multiple times, multiple visits can be added. If there are no visits on an adventure or the date of all visits is in the future, the adventure is considered planned. If the date of the visit is in the past, the adventure is considered completed.
- **Category**: a category is a way to group adventures together. For example, you could have a category for parks, a category for museums, and a category for restaurants.

- **Image**: an image is a photo that is added to an adventure. Images can be added to an adventure to provide a visual representation of the location or to capture a memory of the visit.

- **Attachment**: an attachment is a file that is added to an adventure. Attachments can be added to an adventure to provide additional information, such as a map of the location or a brochure from the visit.

#### Collections

- **Collection**: a collection is a way to group adventures together. Collections are flexible and can be used in many ways.

With start and end dates, the collection is transformed into a full itinerary with a map showing the route taken between adventures.

This can be used to show the route taken between locations and the mode of transportation used. It can also be used to track flight information, such as flight number and departure time.

- **Note**: a note is a collection exclusive feature that allows you to add notes to your trip.
