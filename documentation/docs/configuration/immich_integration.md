Immich is a self-hosted, open-source platform that allows users to backup and manage their photos and videos similar to Google Photos, but with the advantage of storing data on their own private server, ensuring greater privacy and control over their media.

### How to integrate Immich with AdventureLog?

To integrate Immich with AdventureLog, you need to have an Immich server running and accessible from where AdventureLog is running.

1. Obtain the Immich API Key from the Immich server.
   - In the Immich web interface, click on your user profile picture, go to `Account Settings` > `API Keys`.
   - Click `New API Key` and name it something like `AdventureLog`.
   - Make sure the key has the following permissions: `asset.read, album.read, asset.view, library.read, user.read`
   - Copy the generated API Key, you will need it in the next step.
2. Go to the AdventureLog web interface, click on your user profile picture, go to `Settings` and scroll down to the `Immich Integration` section.
   - Enter the URL of your Immich server, e.g. `https://immich.example.com/api`. Note that `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` will probably not work because Immich and AdventureLog are running on different docker networks. It is recommended to use the IP address of the server where Immich is running ex `http://my-server-ip:port` or a domain name.
   - Paste the API Key you obtained in the previous step.
   - Click `Enable Immich` to save the settings.
3. Now, when you are adding images to an adventure, you will see an option to search for images in Immich or upload from an album.

Enjoy the privacy and control of managing your travel media with Immich and AdventureLog! ðŸŽ‰
