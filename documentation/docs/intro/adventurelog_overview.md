## Why AdventureLog?

AdventureLog was created to solve a problem: the lack of a modern, open-source, user-friendly travel companion. Many existing travel apps are either too complex, too expensive, or too closed-off to be useful for the average traveler. AdventureLog aims to be the opposite: simple, beautiful, and open to everyone.
